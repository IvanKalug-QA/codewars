# Find the area of a rectangle when provided with one diagonal and one side of the rectangle. If the input diagonal is less than or equal to the length of the side, return "Not a rectangle". If the resultant area has decimals round it to two places.

def area(d, l): 
    if d <= l:
        return "Not a rectangle"
    w = (d ** 2 - l ** 2) ** 0.5
    s = l * w
    return round(s, 2)
