# INTRODUCTION
# The Club Doorman will give you a word. To gain access, you need to provide the right number according to the given word.
#
# Each word contains exactly one pair of consecutive identical letters, such as the tt in lettuce.
#
# To determine the number, find the position of the repeated letter in the alphabet (where a is 1, b is 2, ..., z is 26) and multiply it by 3.
#
# TASK
# Implement a function that takes a word as input and returns the correct number.
#
# EXAMPLE
# For the word lettuce, the repeated letter is t, which is the 20th letter in the alphabet.
#
# The correct answer is 20 Ã— 3 = 60.
#
# NOTE
# You may assume that the given string will
#
# always contain exactly one pair of consecutive identical letters.
#
# consist only of lowercase English letters.
