# The objective is to write a method that takes two integer parameters and returns a single integer equal to the number of 1s in the binary representation of the greatest common divisor of the parameters.

# Taken from Wikipedia: "In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4."

# For example: the greatest common divisor of 300 and 45 is 15. The binary representation of 15 is 1111, so the correct output would be 4.

# If both parameters are 0, the method should return 0. The function must be able to handle negative input.
