# Task
# Given a string, you need to gradually pull apart the string and return an array of three strings (in Haskell, a tuple of (String, String, Maybe Char)).

# You should repeat both of the following steps together until the original string length is less than 2:

# a) Remove the last character from the original string, append it to the 1st solution string.

# b) Remove the first character from the original string, append it to the 2nd solution string.

# Once the original string length becomes less than 2, the remaining character from the original string (if any) is assigned to the 3rd solution.

# Example
# "exampletesthere" becomes: ["erehtse","example","t"]

# Step	Original String	1st String	2nd String	Remaining String
# 1	exampletesthere	e	e	xampletesther
# 2	xampletesther	er	ex	ampletesthe
# 3	ampletesthe	ere	exa	mpletesth
# 4	mpletesth	ereh	exam	pletest
# 5	pletest	ereht	examp	letes
# 6	letes	erehts	exampl	ete
# 7	ete	erehtse	example	t
# The Kata title gives a hint of one technique to solve.
