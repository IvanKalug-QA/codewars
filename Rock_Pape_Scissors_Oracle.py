# You are the rock paper scissors oracle.
#
# Famed throughout the land, you have the incredible ability to predict which hand gestures your opponent will choose out of rock, paper and scissors.
#
# Unfortunately you're no longer a youngster, and have trouble moving your hands between rounds. For this reason, you can only pick a single gesture for each opponent. If it's possible for you to win, you will, but you're also happy to tie.
#
# Given an array of gestures â€” for example ["paper", "scissors", "scissors"] â€” return the winning gesture/s in the order in which they appear in the title, separated by a forward slash. For example, if rock and scissors could both be used to win you would return:
#
# "rock/scissors"
#
# If it's not possible for you to win then return:
#
# "tie"
#
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors if you're not familiar with rock paper scissors.

# Second attempt at my first Kata...
