# Consider a matchmaking system that is designed to deliver jobs to software developers on a continual basis. As more quality jobs are handpicked into the system, they will be matched to all the enrolled developers; affording them better opportunities daily.
#
# This means that somewhere in the system there exists functionality to take a job and match it against enrolled candidates. There are several factors that go into this matching, but we'll focus on two for the purposes of this Kata.
#
# Create a function match which takes a job, and filters a list of candidates to the ones that match the job. We'll focus on two matching properties for this Kata: equity and location.
#
# Equity
# The candidate has an equity property (boolean) indicating if they desire equity, while the job will have a maximum equity property (float) representing the max amount of equity offered. If the maximum equity is zero, we can infer there is no equity offered. A job will match unless the candidate desires equity, but the job does not offer any.
#
# Location
# The candidate will have two location properties: current location and desired locations. A job can be located in multiple places as well which will be represented by its locations property. A match is when a job location is either in the candidate's current location or any of the candidate's desired locations.
#
# So the candidate list might look like this:
#
# candidates = [{
#   'desires_equity': True,
#   'current_location': 'New York',
#   'desired_locations': ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
# }, ...]
# And a job might look like this:
#
# job = {
#   'equity_max': 1.2,
#   'locations': ['New York', 'Kentucky']
# }

def match(job, candidates):
    return [c for c in candidates
            if not (c['desires_equity'] and job['equity_max'] == 0)
            and any(loc in c['desired_locations'] + [c['current_location']]
                   for loc in job['locations'])]
