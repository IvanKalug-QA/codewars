# Implement a function which takes a sequence of objects and a property name, and returns a sequence containing the named property of each object.
#
# For example:
#
# pluck([{'a':1}, {'a':2}], 'a')        # -> [1,2]
# pluck([{'a':1, 'b':3}, {'a':2}], 'b') # -> [3, None]
# If an object is missing the property, you should just leave it as undefined/None in the output array.

def pluck(objs, name):
    return [i.get(name, None) for i in objs]
